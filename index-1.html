<h1 id="quorum-maker-v24">Quorum Maker V2.4</h1>
<p>Synechron's Quorum Maker is a tool that allows users to create and manage Quorum network. Manually editing configuration files and creating nodes is a slow and error-prone process. Quorum Maker can create any number of nodes of various configurations dynamically with reduced user input. This provides a wizard-like interface with a series of questions to guide the user when creating nodes. Quorum Maker can create nodes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run with docker-compose (Raft consensus/Quorum 2.0.2) for easy use in development environments; or,</li>
<li>nodes to be distributed on separate Linux boxes or cloud instances for a production environment (Raft consensus/Quorum 2.0.2)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<p>The first step to use Quorum Maker is to clone the source code from GitHub.</p>
<p><code>bash
$ git clone git@github.com:synechron-finlabs/quorum-maker.git</code></p>
<p>Once the repository is successfully cloned, change to the Quorum Maker directory by <code>$ cd quorum-maker</code> and run <code>$ ./setup.sh</code> script. To minimize the pre-requisites and make setup easy, Quorum Maker uses docker and rest of the dependencies are baked to <code>syneblock/quorum-maker</code> image.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-quorum-testdevelopment-network">Setting up Quorum Test/Development Network</h2>
<p>Quorum Maker allows to quickly spin up a Quorum network for development or test purpose using Docker Compose with minimal input. Nodes created would be fully functional with all the features of Quorum as well as Quorum Maker. This allows developers to experiment with latest features with different number of nodes.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-nodes">Setting up nodes</h3>
<p>Once the repository is successfully cloned, change to the Quorum Maker directory by <code>$ cd quorum-maker</code> and run <code>$ ./setup.sh</code> script. Choose the option <code>4</code> to Setup Development/Test Network. This will ask you to provide a project name and number of nodes to be created. You can either leave to the default values or enter your choice.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 7" src="screenshot7-1.png"/></p>
<p>A series of commands will be executed and you can see that a new directory with the name of the project your entered get created. This directory contains a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and as many directories as the number of nodes you asked to create.</p>
<h2 id="running-testdevelopment-network">Running Test/Development Network</h2>
<p>After the project is created, change to the directory just created and run <code>$ docker-compose up</code> to bring up the network. You will see each node coming up and node managers for each node getting started. Once the activities stop, you will have a fully functioning Quorum Network running.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 8" src="screenshot8-1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:
By default Quorum Maker creates bridge network with <code>subnet: 10.50.0.0/16</code> and <code>gateway: 10.50.0.1</code>. If you would like to run multiple Quorum Network on same machine, change this setting on the generated <code>docker-compose</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each node created gets it own IP address starting with <code>10.50.0.2</code>. Following are the standard ports used by Quorum Maker.</p>
<p><code>RPC Port : 22000</code><br/>
<code>Whisper Port : 22001</code><br/>
<code>Constellation Port : 22002</code><br/>
<code>RPC Port : 22003</code><br/>
<code>Quorum Maker Node Manager Port : 22004</code></p>
<p>You can now connect to the Quorum Maker UI for each node from a web browser by pointing to <code>http://10.50.0.2:22004</code>, <code>http://10.50.0.3:22004</code> etc.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 9" src="screenshot9-1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: By default, Quorum Maker doesn't expose ports to the host due to possible conflicts, when running Development/Test Network. You can update <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to expose any port you would like to be accessible outside your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setting-up-quorum-network-on-multiple-machines">Setting up Quorum Network on multiple machines</h2>
<p>Quorum Maker supports creating nodes on multiple machines and form a fully decentralized Quorum network. Each node administrators can clone Quorum Maker and run the same <code>setup.sh</code> script create a new network or join an existing one.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-first-node">Creating the first node</h3>
<p>Once the repository is successfully cloned, change to the Qorum Maker directory by <code>$ cd quorum-maker</code> and run <code>$ ./setup.sh</code> script.</p>
<p>After the required docker images are downloaded, Quorum Maker will present with few questions to complete the node setup.</p>
<p><code>Please select an option:</code><br/>
<code>1) Create Network</code><br/>
<code>2) Join Network</code><br/>
<code>3) Attach to an existing Node</code><br/>
<code>4) Setup Development/Test Network</code><br/>
<code>5) Exit</code></p>
<p><code>option:</code> 1<br/>
<code>Please enter node name:</code> Org1<br/>
<code>Please enter IP Address of this node:</code> 10.0.2.15<br/>
<code>Please enter RPC Port of this node[Default:22000]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Network Listening Port of this node[Default:22001]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Constellation Port of this node[Default:22002]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Raft Port of this node[Default:22003]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Node Manager Port of this node[Default:22004]:</code></p>
<p>This completes the creator node startup procedure. Quorum Maker collects the user provided parameters in order to generate geth and constellation inside the docker container. It also starts the NodeManager service.  and creates a directory with the node name provided. This directory has the script to start the node and other files required. You can stop the node any time using <code>Ctrl + C</code>, and restart by running <code>./start.sh</code> from the node directory (Eg. <code>Org1</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 1" src="screenshot1-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="joining-a-network">Joining a Network</h3>
<p>Once a node is created, you can create and join more nodes to form a Quorum Network. Ideally subsequent nodes should be created on other computers. If you are creating another node on the same computer, please make sure to use different ports. In this case you can use the same Quorum Maker clone, since it creates separate directories for each node.</p>
<p><code>bash
$ cd quorum-maker
$ ./setup.sh</code></p>
<p>After the required docker images are downloaded, Quorum Maker will present users with a few questions to complete the node setup.</p>
<p><code>Please select an option:</code><br/>
<code>1) Create Network</code><br/>
<code>2) Join Network</code><br/>
<code>3) Attach to an existing Node</code><br/>
<code>4) Setup Development/Test Network</code><br/>
<code>5) Exit</code></p>
<p><code>option:</code> 2<br/>
<code>Please enter node name:</code> Org2<br/>
<code>Please enter IP Address of existing node:</code> 10.0.2.15<br/>
<code>Please enter Node Manager Port of existing node:</code> 22004<br/>
<code>Please enter IP Address of this node:</code> 14.0.2.30<br/>
<code>Please enter RPC Port of this node[Default:22000]:</code>24000<br/>
<code>Please enter Network Listening Port of this node[Default:24001]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Constellation Port of this node[Default:24002]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Raft Port of this node[Default:24003]:</code><br/>
<code>Please enter Node Manager Port of this node[Default:24004]:</code></p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2" src="screenshot2-1.png"/></p>
<p>At this point, a directory with the node name is created and most of the files are created. To join the existing network, the active node requires the Genesis file specific to the network. Quorum Maker will contact the node chose in the wizard and request permission to join and receive the Genesis file. An administrator of that node will get notifications on UI and e-mail for the join request and needs to approve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The joining node will wait 5 minutes for the approval. If the request is not approved within that time, the Quorum Maker will quit. But the administrator of the other node can approve the request any time. Once the request is approved, the node can be restarted by executing <code>./start.sh</code> from the directory created and the setup will be resumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="approvereject-join-request">Approve/Reject Join Request</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once a join request has been sent by a node willing to join a network to one of the existing network participants, this node has the option to approve/reject this join request</li>
<li>If the join request is accepted, the main node's constellation port, genesis file and network ID is returned to the joiner. If the join request is rejected, the joiner's setup script exits</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 3" src="screenshot3-1.png"/></p>
<h2 id="attaching-quorum-maker-to-existing-quorum-node">Attaching Quorum Maker to existing Quorum node</h2>
<p>You can enjoy most of the features of Quorum Maker by attaching it to an existing Quorum Node. By having all existing nodes attached through Quorum Maker, it can eventually provide all features as native setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Currently this is an expiremental feature and only Block and Transaction explorers are fully functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the repository is successfully cloned, change to the Quorum Maker directory by <code>$ cd quorum-maker</code> and run <code>$ ./setup.sh</code> script.</p>
<p>After the required docker images are downloaded, Quorum Maker will present with few questions to complete the node setup. </p>
<p><code>Please select an option:</code><br/>
<code>1) Create Network</code><br/>
<code>2) Join Network</code><br/>
<code>3) Attach to an existing Node</code><br/>
<code>4) Setup Development/Test Network</code><br/>
<code>5) Exit</code>
<code>option:</code> 3<br/>
<code>Please enter node name:</code> MyRemoteNode<br/>
<code>Please enter the IP Address of Geth:</code> 35.231.238.41<br/>
<code>Please enter the Public Key of Constellation:</code> emupTbaUhpqUvezg4e4O2LywHer34qHAABNz+vAwWns=<br/>
<code>Please enter the RPC Port of Geth[Default:22000]:</code>
<code>Please enter the Network Listening Port of Geth[Default:22001]:</code>
<code>Please enter the Constellation Port[Default:22002]:</code>
<code>Please enter the Raft Port[Default:22003]:</code>
<code>Please enter the Node Manager Port of this node[Default:22004]:</code>
<code>Please enter the Attachment Mode of this node (1 for active and 2 for passive)[Default:1]:</code>1  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Except Node Manager port, all other details are of existing node. Please make sure to use an available port for Node Manager to avoid port conflicts.</p>
<p>Note: If the existing node is running locally, do not use 127.0.0.1 for the IP Address while attaching, since Quorum Maker run inside docker. Use the host IP address. </p>
<p>Note: Currently Quorum Maker assumes empty password for defualt (coinbase) account of exising Quorum Node. In a futre release Quorum Maker will support non empty passwords. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 13" src="screenshot13-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="active-attachment">Active Attachment</h3>
<p>Active Attachment allows you to migrate your existing nodes that was not created with Quorum Maker to a fully Quorum Maker equivalent. At the core, Quorum Maker uses Network Map Contract to share the details of each participant node. Due to security and transperancy reasons, this is a public smart contract. When attaching to a node that was not created using Quorum Maker, it will deploy Network Map Contract. This is an active participation in the network. Quorum Maker can also detect an existing instance of Network Map Contract and only register the node, instead of deploying a new instance. This allows Quorum Maker to act as a native installation once all nodes have Quorum Maker attached. </p>
<h3 id="passive-attachment">Passive Attachment</h3>
<p>If you do not wish Quorum Maker to deploy a public contract but still want to use some of the features of Quorum Maker, you can attach in <strong>Passive</strong> mode. Most of the features except <strong>Node Explorer</strong> work as expected in this mode.</p>
<h3 id="configure-log-paths-and-genesis">Configure Log paths and Genesis</h3>
<p>You can point to the location of your existing node's Geth and Constellation log directories and Quorum Maker can make them accessible through it's UI. When you access the UI after attaching to an exisisting Quorum node, a notification icon appears on the top right corner. Click on this to open up the window to enter the location of the log directory. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Due to browser security restrictions, <strong>File Chooser</strong> doesn't pickup the fully qualified path of a directory. Please enter this manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quorum Maker attached to an existing node can even approve join requests. To enable this feature choose the <strong>Genesis</strong> file of this network. </p>
<p>After you <strong>SUBMIT</strong> changes, please restart Quorum Maker Node to make the changes effect. </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 21" src="screenshot21-1.png"/></p>
<h2 id="non-interactive-setup">Non Interactive Setup</h2>
<p>By default Quorum Maker runs in Wizard mode to walk user through the setup process. But for advanced users this might be time consuming and Quorum Maker provides non-interactive mode to speed up the setup. It also useful to run in non-interactive mode from shell scripts or DevOps tools. </p>
<p>For a quick help on usage and options available, run <code>./setup.sh -h</code> or <code>./setup.sh --help</code></p>
<p>Quorum Maker follows Unix style flags, prefixed with <code>-</code> for single letter flags and <code>--</code> for multi letter flags.</p>
<p>Default usage is <code>./setup.sh COMMAND [OPTIONS]</code></p>
<h3 id="create-node">Create Node</h3>
<p>Run <code>./setup.sh create [OPTIONS]</code> for creating node. Following are the options available.</p>
<p><code>For create command:
  -n, --name              Name of the node to be created

<h2 id="quorum-maker-web-ui">Quorum Maker Web UI</h2>
<h3 id="node-explorer">Node Explorer</h3>
<p>Quorum Maker provides a web interface to monitor the network. You can explore the blocks getting created and the transactions in them. Node admin can watch the performance of their node and other connected nodes to ensure availability and network resilience.</p>
<p>Administrators can view geth and constellation logs from Quorum Maker.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 4" src="screenshot4-1.png"/></p>
<p>Click on the node name of the table to view node details. You can also update the node name and role of your own node. Node name and Role are useful in a large network to identify the peers before sending transactions. Refer to the Quorum Maker API below to access node details using restful clients.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 6" src="screenshot6-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="blockchain-explorer">Blockchain Explorer</h3>
<p>The Blockchain Explorer on Quorum Maker is customized for Quorum. You can click on the big block number button, and the blockchain explorer will be displayed. From here you can scroll through blocks, search by any content or expand to view more details. Transactions for the selected block is displayed on the right side and all the transactions belong to the block is highlighted in yellow. You can expand each transaction and view more details. Quorum has 3 types of transactions; public, private and Hash Only. Public transactions can be seen by every node on the network and is marked with a blue color <span style="color:blue">Public</span> label. Private transactions are available to your node to view and marked with a green color <span style="color:green">Private</span> label. Either you were a sender or recipient to these transactions. You can only the see the hash of the transactions to those you were not a party to. These are marked with a red color <span style="color:red">Hash Only</span> label. </p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 10" src="screenshot10-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="transaction-parameters-view">Transaction Parameters View</h3>
<p>Quorum Maker can decode the sendTransaction parameters and displayed in human readable format. This is can aid both developers and node administrators get more visual details of the transactions in the network.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 17" src="screenshot17-1.png"/></p>
<p>To view the transaction parameters, select the transaction from the Transaction Explorer and scroll down to the end. Signature of the function and the decoded values in a table format will be displayed. You can mouse over to view any values truncated due to display real estate limitations.</p>
<p>To decode the values, Quoroum Maker requires ABI file of the Smart Contract. All contracts deployed through Quorum Maker has ABI available and the values will be decoded automatically. You can upload/attach the ABI file of the Smart Contract you deployed externally from the Smart Contract Explorer.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 18" src="screenshot18-1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Currently Quorum Maker supports ABI files generated by Truffle, solc compiler and solc Node.JS version.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="contract-deployment">Contract Deployment</h3>
<p>Smart contracts can be deployed from Quorum Maker. Users can choose solidity files (Even multiple contracts !) and deploy them publicly  or privately.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple contracts can be uploaded via the Compile and Deploy Tab</li>
<li>The source .sol files are compiled using solc and subsequently deployed</li>
<li>Quourm Maker can support inheritance. For this, source code of related contracts should be in same file.  </li>
<li>The deployment is done either publicly or privately</li>
<li>In case of private deployment the public keys of the concerned parties are sent from the UI</li>
<li>The list of network participants and their corresponding public keys are fetched using a REST API call </li>
<li>Error messages that occur from compilation failures are also displayed on the UI</li>
</ol>
<p>All the deployed contracts are easily accessible from the UI in the format contractAddress_contractName and contain the corresponding ABI, Bytecode and JSON</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 5" src="screenshot5-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="contract-explorer">Contract Explorer</h3>
<p>The Contract Explorer in Quorum Maker can view all the smart contracts deployed in the blockchain network. The Contract Explorer displays both public and private Smart Contracts. You can also view the details of them and attach ABI of those missing.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 14" src="screenshot14-1.png"/></p>
<p>The orange button on the top-right side of dashboard shows the total number contracts deployed on the blockchain. Click on this button to view the Contract Explorer. It also displays the ABI files available. All contracts deployed through Quorum Maker has ABI available already. If you are deploying through an external tool like Truffle, you can attach the ABI of the contract, so that transaction details of the contract can be viewed.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 16" src="screenshot16-1.png"/></p>
<p>Contract Explorer works hand-in-hand with Block and Transaction Explorer. Please read sections on Transaction Explorer for more details.</p>
<h3 id="log-viewer">Log Viewer</h3>
<p>You can view both Geth and Constellation logs from the Quorum Maker UI. In any event of failure, quick access to logs are important. Combined with E-Mail notification feature, administrators can even check the logs from a mobile device and spot errors. Quorum Maker also rotates the logs to keep the file size minimal.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 11" src="screenshot11-1.png"/></p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-email-notification">Monitoring and Email Notification</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is an active monitoring system which checks whether the node is up every 30 seconds. If it fails to get the expected response which indicates that the node is functional, it waits for another 30 seconds and performs the health check again. If the check fails again then the user is notified</li>
<li>The user is sent an email notification indicating that the node has gone down. The node admin must preconfigure the notification procedure by providing the following details on <strong>Email Server Configuration</strong> menu on UI:  <ul>
<li>SMTP Sever Host</li>
<li>Port</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Recipient E-Mail list (Comma separated)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 12" src="screenshot12-1.png"/> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Quorum Maker an also notify a request for join from another node. This lets node administrators not be online all the time to approve/reject a request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a new node is joined, Quorum Maker notifies this to all node administrators with both Joiner and Approver details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 template files are available, one for each type of notification email. </p>
</li>
<li>JoinRequestTemplate.txt</li>
<li>NodeUnavailableTemplate.txt</li>
<li>TestMailTemplate.txt</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="auto-abi-upload-for-truffle-deployments">Auto ABI upload for Truffle Deployments</h2>
<p>Even though Smart Contracts can be deployed from Quorum Maker UI, we recommend to use specialized tools like Truffle (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) for this. Quorum Maker can automatically attach the ABI files generated by Truffle to the smart contracts deployed on the node. This allows you to view the Smart Contract Functions called and the parameters without having to attach the ABIs manually. </p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to enable auto attaching of ABIs. </p>
<ol>
<li>Quorum Maker stores smart contract inside the directory <strong>$nodeName/node/contracts</strong>, here $nodeName is the name of the node you choose while creating the node using Quorum Maker.</li>
<li>Create a symbolic link to your Truffle directory inside Quorum Maker contract directory. (E.g. <strong>$nodeName/node/contract/myTruffleOutput</strong>)</li>
<li>Quorum Maker will automatically detect new files getting saved by Truffle and auto attach them to the smart contracts deployed. </li>
</ol>
